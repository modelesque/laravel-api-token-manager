# API Token Manager for Laravel

---
**This package is still under construction and not yet a Composer package.**

---

Note that this package has a migration that will set up an `api_tokens` table in your database. How the package functions is talked about in detail [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/modelesque/9468e240ac86e4ef82817d884027e97d#file-emotionalists-code-walkthrough-02-backend-md). It will require an API package like [this one for Spotify](https://github.com/modelesque/laravel-web-api-spotify) that will use it to store auth access tokens.

More coming soon...
